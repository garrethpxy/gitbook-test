# Omnitive Converse v3.2.0

## **What is Converse?**

Omnitive Converse is a Conversation AI solution that allows you to build and manage Bots \(also known as Virtual Assistants\). Bots are autonomous, always-on representatives of your business that can help service your Customers or Employees needs across a wide variety of scenarios.

Converse Bots are able to:

* Interpret and answer user questions
* Guide users to relevant information
* Perform transactions on behalf of users

For example, a HR Bot can be configured to help your employees process their expense claims and a Customer Support Bot can help answer frequently asked questions and reset a customer's account password.

## **What does Converse offer?**

Omnitive Converse allows you to create engaging conversation experiences, and allow your customers & employees to become more productive.

The core modules found in Converse are:

* **Intent Dashboard** - to manage the list of intents for the Bot
* **Intent Editor** - use for building content and conversations
* **Libraries** - for organising and access control of the intents
* **Bots** - to manage the Bots and making changes to look & feel for each Bot
* **Common Space** - a knowledge base where Bots can share common intents
* **Unhandled Phrase Manager** - for triaging of unseen phrases
* **Analytics** - to visualising the performance of the Bot
* **Plugins** - to manage the different plugins uploaded in Converse

As chat has become ubiquitous and accessible to users of all skill levels, no training is required for end-users to interact with Bots you create.
